                        <div class="faq-question">What constitutes a handyman emergency?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Handyman emergencies include burst pipes, electrical hazards, storm damage, security issues (broken locks/doors), heating/cooling failures, and any situation affecting your family's safety or causing ongoing property damage.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">Emergency calls have a service charge to cover after-hours response, but we don't engage in price gouging. Our emergency rates are fair and clearly explained when you call. We believe in honest pricing even during urgent situations.</div>
