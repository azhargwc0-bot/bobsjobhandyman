        <h3>The Beginning in Virginia Beach</h3>
        <p>Bob's Jobs Handyman started with a simple mission: provide honest, reliable handyman services to Virginia Beach homeowners. Founded by Bob, a lifelong Virginia Beach resident with over 15 years of construction and home repair experience, the company began as a one-person operation helping neighbors with small home repairs and improvements.</p>
        <p>Understanding the unique challenges of coastal living in Virginia Beach - from salt air corrosion to hurricane preparedness - Bob focused on building expertise in the specific needs of Tidewater homes. Word spread quickly through local neighborhoods about the quality work and fair pricing.</p>

        <h3>Growing with Virginia Beach</h3>
        <p>By 2017, demand for reliable handyman services in Virginia Beach had grown so much that Bob's Jobs expanded to include 24/7 emergency repair services. Virginia Beach homeowners needed someone they could call when storms caused damage or when urgent repairs couldn't wait for regular business hours.</p>
        <p>We also began specializing in professional furniture assembly, recognizing that busy Virginia Beach families needed help with the increasingly complex furniture from online retailers. Our systematic approach and professional tools made us the go-to choice for IKEA assembly and other furniture installation needs.</p>

        <h3>Mastering Virginia Beach Home Challenges</h3>
        <p>As our experience grew, we developed specialized expertise in drywall repair and texture matching - crucial skills for Virginia Beach homes dealing with settling, humidity, and occasional storm damage. Our perfect texture and paint matching became legendary among local homeowners.</p>
        <p>We also became certified for lead-safe work practices, essential for Virginia Beach's many historic homes. Our team learned to work with the unique construction styles found throughout Virginia Beach neighborhoods, from Oceanfront condos to suburban homes in Kempsville and Princess Anne.</p>
