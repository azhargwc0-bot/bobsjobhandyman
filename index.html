                    <h3>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
                    <p>We accept cash, checks, and all major credit cards for your convenience. For larger projects, we can discuss payment plans. Payment is typically due upon completion of work, and we'll always discuss costs upfront so there are never any surprises.</p>

                    <h3>How do I know if a job is too big for a handyman?</h3>
                    <p>Great question! We handle most home repairs and improvements, but for major electrical work requiring permits, structural changes, or large plumbing projects, we'll refer you to specialized contractors we trust. We're always honest about whether we're the right fit for your project.</p>

                    <h3>Do you clean up after completing work?</h3>
                    <p>Always. We believe leaving your home cleaner than we found it is part of professional service. We'll clean up all debris, protect your floors and furniture during work, and do a final walkthrough with you to ensure everything meets your standards.</p>

                    <p>Virginia Beach has many beautiful older homes, and we love working on them. Whether it's dealing with plaster walls, older electrical systems, or unique architectural features, our experience with homes of all ages helps us find solutions that work with your home's character.</p>

                    <h3>What should I do to prepare for your visit?</h3>
                    <p>Just clear the work area if possible and make sure we can access the spaces where work needs to be done. If you have pets, please let us know so we can take appropriate precautions. We'll bring all necessary tools and materials unless we've discussed otherwise.</p>

                    <h3>Do you offer any warranties on your work?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, all our work comes with a satisfaction guarantee, and we provide specific warranties based on the type of work performed. For example, drywall repairs are warranted for one year, and furniture assembly comes with a 90-day guarantee. We'll explain the warranty terms for your specific job.</p>

                    <h3>How far in advance do I need to schedule non-emergency work?</h3>
                    <p>For regular maintenance and improvement projects, we can usually schedule within 3-5 business days. During busy seasons (spring and fall), it might take a bit longer. For time-sensitive projects, just let us know and we'll do our best to accommodate your timeline.</p>

                    <h3>Why should I hire a professional handyman instead of doing it myself?</h3>
                    <p>While DIY can be rewarding, professional work saves you time, ensures safety, and often costs less than you might think when you factor in tools, materials, and the value of your time. Plus, our experience means we can spot potential problems before they become expensive repairs.</p>
