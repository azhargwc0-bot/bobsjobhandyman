                    <p>
                        As lifelong Virginia Beach residents, we understand the unique challenges of coastal living. Salt air accelerates wear on fixtures and hardware. Hurricane season requires special preparation and quick storm damage response. High humidity affects wood, drywall, and paint differently than inland areas. Our local expertise means we know exactly how to address these coastal-specific issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the Oceanfront district to Kempsville, from Hilltop to Princess Anne, we've worked in every Virginia Beach neighborhood. We know which local suppliers have the best materials, understand city permitting requirements, and maintain relationships with other trusted local contractors for larger projects that require specialized expertise.
